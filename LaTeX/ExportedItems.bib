              The icy outer shell of Jupiter's moon Europa is believed to be geologically active, and geological processes within the ice may be key to sustaining chemical disequilibria and potentially habitable environments within the icy shell and ocean. Currently, there are insufficient observational data to determine the thickness of the icy shell, obfuscating crucial aspects of interior processes. Although a range of icy shell thicknesses (∼10

In this study, I construct a probability density distribution for Europa's present-day mean icy shell thickness using a heat flux balance, assuming a simple two-layered model consisting of a partially porous conductive upper layer, and a ductile interior layer that may be experiencing solid-state convection. Current best estimate (CBE) values and uncertainties for ∼20 key parameters are propagated through this steady-state heat flux balance to construct ∼10

              independent simulations. Additionally, I estimate present-day values for the icy shell layer thicknesses, the rocky interior and icy heat fluxes, icy shell thermal properties, and convective ice viscosity. I predict Europa’s total icy thickness to be ∼23–47 km, with a CBE thickness of

	abstract = {In order to examine the potential of seismology to determine the interior structure and properties of Europa, it is essential to calculate seismic velocities and attenuation for the range of plausible interiors. We calculate a range of models for the physical structure of Europa, as constrained by the satellite's composition, mass, and moment of inertia. We assume a water‐ice shell, a pyrolitic or a chondritic mantle, and a core composed of pure iron or iron plus 20 weight percent of sulfur. We consider two extreme mantle thermal states: hot and cold. Given a temperature and composition, we determine density, seismic velocities, and attenuation using thermodynamical models. While anelastic effects will be negligible in a cold mantle and the brittle part of the ice shell, strong dispersion and dissipation are expected in a hot convective mantle and the bulk of the ice shell. There is a strong relationship between different thermal structures and compositions. The “hot” mantle may maintain temperatures consistent with a liquid core made of iron plus light elements. For the “cold scenarios,” the possibility of a solid iron core cannot be excluded, and it may even be favored. The depths of the ocean and core‐mantle boundary are determined with high precision, 10 km and 40 km, respectively, once we assume a composition and thermal structure. Furthermore, the depth of the ocean is relatively insensitive (4 km) to the core composition used.},

	abstract = {Europa’s ocean lies atop an interior made of metal and silicates. On the basis of gravity data from the Galileo mission, many argued that Europa’s interior, like Earth, is differentiated into a metallic core and a mantle composed of anhydrous silicates. Some studies further assumed that Europa differentiated while (or soon after) it accreted, also like Earth. However, Europa probably formed at much colder temperatures, meaning that Europa plausibly ended accretion as a mixture containing water-ice and/or hydrated silicates. Here, we use numerical models to describe the thermal evolution of Europa’s interior assuming low initial temperatures ({\textasciitilde}200 to 300 kelvin). We find that silicate dehydration can produce Europa’s current ocean and icy shell. Rocks below the seafloor may remain cool and hydrated today. Europa’s metallic core, if it exists, may have formed billions of years after accretion. Ultimately, we expect the chemistry of Europa’s ocean to reflect protracted heating of the interior.
